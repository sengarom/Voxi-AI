🚀 Overview

Voxi AI is a powerful, open-source platform designed for advanced audio analysis. It seamlessly integrates state-of-the-art AI models to provide a comprehensive suite of tools for processing multilingual audio content. Whether you're a developer, researcher, or content creator, Voxi AI empowers you to unlock valuable insights from your audio files with ease.

Our platform offers a user-friendly web interface and a command-line tool to access its core functionalities, including speaker diarization, automatic speech recognition (ASR), language detection, and translation.
✨ Key Features

    🗣️ Speaker Diarization: Accurately identifies and separates different speakers in an audio file.

    🎙️ Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR): Transcribes spoken words into text with high accuracy.

    🌍 Language Detection: Automatically detects the language being spoken in each audio segment.

    🔄 Translation: Translates transcribed text from various languages into English.

    🖥️ Web-Based UI: An intuitive and responsive interface for easy file uploads and results visualization.

    ⚙️ Flexible Processing: Supports a wide range of audio formats, including .wav, .mp3, .flac, .ogg, and .m4a.

    🔊 Audio Preprocessing: Automatically converts all uploaded audio to a standardized format (16kHz, mono WAV) for consistent and reliable processing.

🛠️ Technology Stack

Voxi AI is built with a robust and scalable technology stack:

    Backend: Python with Flask

    ASR: OpenAI Whisper / SpeechBrain

    Translation: Helsinki-NLP

    Speaker Diarization: pyannote.audio / SpeechBrain

    Audio Manipulation: pydub

    Frontend: HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript

🏛️ Architecture and Project Structure

The Voxi AI processing pipeline is as follows:

    File Upload: The user uploads an audio file through the web interface or specifies a file path via CLI.

    Audio Conversion: The uploaded file is converted to a standardized WAV format.

    Speaker Diarization: The audio is analyzed to identify and timestamp speaker segments.

    ASR & Language Detection: Each segment is transcribed, and its language is identified.

    Translation: If a segment is not in English, it is translated.

    Results Display: The processed information is sent to the frontend for display or saved to output files.

🏁 Getting Started

Follow these steps to get Voxi AI up and running on your local machine.
Prerequisites

    Python 3.8 or higher

    pip for package management

    ffmpeg: Ensure it is installed and available in your system's PATH. This is required for audio format conversion.

Installation

    Clone the repository:

    git clone https://github.com/sengarom/Voxi-AI.git
    cd Voxi-AI

    Install the required packages:

    pip install -r requirements.txt

    Run the application:

    python app.py

    Access the web interface:
    Open your browser and navigate to http://127.0.0.1:5000.

📖 How to Use
Using the Web Interface

    Upload an Audio File: Drag and drop or browse to select an audio file.

    Select Options: Choose the processing tasks you want to perform.

    Process: Click the "Process Audio" button to start the analysis.

    View Results: The results will be displayed in organized tabs for the transcript, speakers, and translation.

Using the Command-Line Interface (CLI)

You can also process files directly from your terminal.

python main.py --file path/to/your/sample_audio.mp3 --output result.json

This will generate result.json with the structured output and result.txt with a human-readable transcript.
🔧 Best Practices

    For best performance, keep uploaded audio files under 50 MB.

    Ensure audio quality is clear and has minimal background noise for higher accuracy.

    For production environments, consider implementing authentication and more robust file handling.

🌐 Future Enhancements

    Real-time streaming processing

    Integration of more advanced translation models

    Enhanced speaker identification with voice profiles

    Support for a wider range of audio formats and sampling rates
