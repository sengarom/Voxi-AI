# Implementation Notes - OpenAI Whisper

## URGENT: Google Replacement

This implementation was created as an urgent replacement for Google Cloud services. Whisper provides a completely local alternative with no dependency on external APIs.

## Why OpenAI Whisper?

- **100% Local Processing**: Whisper runs entirely on your local machine, no cloud services required
- **Privacy**: No data is sent to external servers
- **No API Keys**: No credentials or API keys needed
- **No Usage Costs**: Free to use without any API usage limits or charges
- **Multilingual Support**: Supports 100+ languages with excellent quality
- **Direct Translation**: Built-in capability to translate audio directly to English

## Implementation Details

1. **ASR (Automatic Speech Recognition)**:
   - Uses OpenAI Whisper for speech-to-text
   - Supports multiple languages automatically
   - Uses language detection to identify the spoken language
   - Processes diarized segments individually for accurate transcription

2. **Translation**:
   - Uses Whisper's built-in translation capability
   - Translates audio directly to English text
   - More accurate than text-based translation for many languages

3. **Model Selection**:
   - Default model is "base" which balances speed and accuracy
   - Can be modified to use other models:
     - "tiny": Fastest but least accurate (~1GB VRAM)
     - "base": Good balance (~1GB VRAM)
     - "small": More accurate (~2GB VRAM)
     - "medium": High quality (~5GB VRAM)
     - "large": Best quality (~10GB VRAM)

## Performance Notes

- First run will download the model (one-time process)
- GPU acceleration is used if available (CUDA)
- CPU fallback available for systems without GPUs
- Processing times vary based on:
  - Audio length
  - Model size
  - Hardware specifications

## Future Improvements

1. Add segment-level translation
2. Implement model size selection in UI
3. Add batch processing capabilities
4. Improve language detection accuracy
